    	<p><em>*sigh*</em> Well, here you are, I guess. Probably came to learn about vocabulary or something. They have examples, too, or whatever. I don't care. Just look below and leave me alone.</p>

    <div id="vocab">
    	<ul>
	    	<li><strong>Act</strong>- an act is a part of a play defined by elements such as rising action, climax and resolution (This can be found in most of Shakespeare's works)</li>

	        <li><strong>Allusion</strong>- an expression designed to call something to mind without mentioning it explicitly; an indirect of passing phrase (... But all so soon as the all-cheering sun, Should in the farthest East begin to draw, The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed)</li>
	        <li><strong>Aside</strong>- lines spoken by an actor that was intended for the audience and not other characters in the play (Oh, ‘tis too true!, How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!, The harlot’s cheek, beautied with plastering art, Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it, Than is my ded to my post painted work., O heavy burden!)</li>
	        <li><strong>Blank verse</strong>- verse without rhyme, especially that which uses iambic pentameter (Hark! What light in yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.)</li>
	        <li><strong>Comic relief</strong>- comic episodes in a dramatic or literary work that offset more serious sections (ROM: I dreamt a dream to-night. MER: And so did I. ROM: Well, what was yours? MER:That dreamers often lie.)</li>
	        <li><strong>Couplet</strong>- two lines of verse, usually in the same meter and joined by rhyme, that form a unit (Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scrope, Being had to triumph; being lacked, to hope)</li>
	        <li><strong>Drama</strong>- a play for theater, radio, or television (This can be found in most of Shakespeare's works)</li>
	        <li><strong>Foil</strong>- a character who contrasts with another character, usually the protagonist, in order to highlight particular qualities of the other character (Mercutio from <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>)</li>
	        <li><strong>Iambic pentameter</strong>- the name given to a line of verse that consists of five iambs (an iamb being one unstressed syllable followed by one stressed, such as ‘before’)(Romeo and Juliet!)</li>
	        <li><strong>Imagery</strong>- visually descriptive or figurative language, especially in a literary work (‘tis an unweeded garden,; that grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature; possess it merely)</li>
	        <li><strong>Irony</strong>– (Can be dramatic, situational, or verbal) the expression of one’s meaning by using language that normally signifies the opposite, typically for humorous or emphatic effect(Go ask his name: if he be married. My grave is like to be my wedding bed.)</li>
	        <li><strong>Monologue</strong>- a long speech by one actor in a play or movie, or as part of a theatrical or broadcast program (Juliet's speech in Act 2, Scene 2 of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>)</li>
	        <li><strong>Soliloquy</strong>- an act of speaking one’s thoughts aloud when by oneself or regardless of any hearers especially by a character in a play ("To be, or not to be: that is the question" from <em>Hamlet</em>)</li>
	        <li><strong>Pun</strong>- a joke exploiting the different possible meanings of a word or the fact that there are words that sound alike but have different meanings (it is the unkindest tied that ever any man tied)</li>
	        <li><strong>Personification</strong>- the attribution of a personal nature or human characteristics to something or the representation of an abstract quality in human form (When well-appareled April on the heel/ Of limping winter treads)</li>
	        <li><strong>Metaphor</strong>- a figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable (Look, love, what envious streaks/ Do lace the severing clouds in yonder/ East: Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day/ Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.)</li>
	        <li><strong>Oxymoron</strong>- a figure of speech in which apparently contradictory terms appear in conjuction (parting is such sweet sorrow)</li>
	        <li><strong>Periphrasis</strong>- the use of indirect and circumlocutory speech or writing (When that fell arrest/ Without all bail shall carry me away)</li>
	        <li><strong>Metonymy</strong>- the substitution of the name of an attribute or adjunct for that of the thing meant (Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears)</li>
	        <li><strong>Synecdoche</strong>- a figure of speech in which a part is made to represent the whole or vice versa (O no! It is an ever-fixed mark/ That looks on tempests and is never shaken)</li>
	        <li><strong>Wordplay</strong>- the witty exploitation of the meanings and ambiguities of words (Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man.)</li>
	        <li><strong>Epithet</strong>- an adjective or descriptive phrase expressing a quality characteristic of the person or thing mentioned (Death lies on her like an untimely frost)</li>
	        <li><strong>Double epithet</strong>- a phrase involving two synonymous adjectives joined by a conjuction ("Kind and gentle", "Clever and insightful", "Strong and noble", etc.)
	        <li><strong>Anaphora</strong>- the use of a word referring to or replacing a word used earlier in a sentence, to avoid repetition (This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England, This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings [...] This land of such dear souls, this dear land)</li>
