    <div id="sInfo">
        <ul>
            <li>Shakespeare was born on April 23, 1564.</li>
            <li>Shakespeare's father was John Shakespeare, a glover and leather merchant.</li>
            <li>Shakespeare attended the grammar school in Stratford.</li>
            <li>Shakespeare married <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hathaway">Anne Hathaway</a>, and had three kids: a daughter Susanne and twins named Hamnet and Judith. Hamnet died in childhood.</li>
            <li>Shakespeare started off his career in London travelling with Will Kempe and Richard Burbage as a troupe called the Lord Chamberlain's Men. After, he owned and acted at the Globe Theatre, the most popular theatre of the time.</li>
            <li>It's supposed that Shakespeare died on his birthday, April 23, in 1623. He was buried at the Holy Trinity in Stratford on April 25, the same place he was born and baptized.</li>
            <li>The first proper theater as we know it was called the Theatre, built at Shoreditch, London in 1576 and the owner was James Burbage. This was the first permanent place plays were performed.</li>
            <li>The Globe Theatre was built from the remains of The Theatre. The Theatre's land lease had expired, and thus the building was owned by the landlord. However, a carpenter came in the night and took apart the theatre.
            <li>The evidence suggests that The Globe was a three-story, open-air amphitheatre approximately 100 feet in diameter that could house up to 3,000 spectators.</li>
            <li>Shakespeare plays were presented during the warmer months in circular, open-air public theaters. In the colder months plays were performed in so-called private indoor theaters for a more elite audience. Any part of the costume was likely to be decorated with braid, embroidery, pinking (pricking in patterns) slashing, or puffing, or it might be encrusted with pearls, jewels, or spangles or trimmed with lace or artificial flowers. Men's clothing, like that of women, was gorgeous with color and ornamentation.</li>
            <li>A groundling was a person who frequented the Globe Theatre in the early 17th century and was too poor to pay to be able to sit on one of the three levels of the theatre. By paying one penny, they could stand in "the pit", also called "the yard", just below the stage to watch the play.</li>
            <li>The stage had two primary parts: 1) The outer stage, which was a rectangular platform projecting into the courtyard, from the back wall. Above it was a thatched roof and hangings but no front or side curtains. 2) The inner stage was the recess between two projecting wings at the very back of the outer stage. This stage was used by actors who were in a scene but not directly involved in the immediate action of the play, and it was also used when a scene took place in an inner room.</li>
            <li>The reputation of the early Elizabethan Actors was not good and any were viewed as no better than rogues and vagabonds - actors were not trusted. The standing of Elizabethan Actors improved when the purpose-built theatres were introduced and some of the Globe Theatre actors became the equivalent of today's superstars.</li>
            <li>High-born characters and national affairs were typical subjects of tragedies.</li>
        </ul>
