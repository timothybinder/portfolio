    	<p>Iambic pentameter is a commonly used type of metrical line in traditional verse and verse drama. The term describes the rhythm that the words establish in that line, which is measured in small groups of syllables called "feet". The word "iambic" describes the type of foot that is used (an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable). The word "pentameter" indicates that a line has five of these "feet".</p>
		<p>These terms originally applied to the quantitative meter of classical poetry. They were adopted to describe the equivalent meters in English accentual-syllabic verse. Different languages express rhythm in different ways. In Ancient Greek and Latin, the rhythm was created through the alternation of short and long syllables. In English, the rhythm is created through the use of stress, alternating between unstressed and stressed syllables. An English unstressed syllable is equivalent to a classical short syllable, while an English stressed syllable is equivalent to a classical long syllable. When a pair of syllables is arranged as a short followed by a long, or an unstressed followed by a stressed, pattern, that foot is said to be "iambic". The English word "trapeze" is an example of an iambic pair of syllables, since the word is made up of two syllables ("tra—peze") and is pronounced with the stress on the second syllable ("tra—PEZE", rather than "TRA—peze"). An iambic pentameter is a line made up of five such pairs of short/long, or unstressed/stressed, syllables.</p>
		<p>An iambic foot is an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable. The rhythm can be written as: <br>da DUM</br></p>
		<p>The da-DUM of a human heartbeat is the most common example of this rhythm. A standard line of iambic pentameter is five iambic feet in a row: <br>da DUM da DUM da DUM da DUM da DUM</br>
		<p>Shakespeare decided to get in on this juicy action, with lines such as: <br>If <strong>mu-</strong> / -sic <strong>be</strong> / the <strong>food</strong> / of <strong>love,</strong> / play <strong>on</strong></br> <br>and </br> <br>Is <strong>this</strong> / a <strong>dag-</strong> / -ger <strong>I</strong> / see <strong>be-</strong> / fore <strong>me?</strong></br>
